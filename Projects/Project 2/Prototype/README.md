# Project 2 - Neo-Tenebris by Joseph Boumerhi

For my final project, I have made a top-down shooter. I feel that what I have done is decent and is part of the vision I had for my project, although I had difficulty seeking ambition, thus resulting in me working on this project slowly. I am proud that I have made this piece of work, and also showcased the prototype in its own little portfolio for my CART 214 class, which was Visual Form & Communication, which we discussed and experimented with graphic design (did it to try and boost my motivation on this project). A criticism would be that I should progressively asked for help, so that the game would have "looked better", the pixel art is nice and was good practice with the tools in the editor I used, Piskel (although I could spent more time on them for details). If I were to say what I should improve, it would be working habits, as right now through this online environment that we find ourselves in, I feel very engrained into habits of being at home, like laying around, playing games (procrastinating in general). Having depression had taken a toll on my motivations, but I am getting the help I need so that I could improve as a student and human.

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.
